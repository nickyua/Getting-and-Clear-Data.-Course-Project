The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals Accelometer-XYZ and Gyroscope-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 'Time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (TimeBodyAccelometer-XYZ and TimeGravityAccelometer-XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (TimeBodyAccelometerJerk-XYZ and TimeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (TimeBodyAccelometerMagnitude, 
TimeGravityAccelometerMagnitude, TimeBodyAccelometerJerkMagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopeMagnitude, TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyBodyAccelometer-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelometerJerk-XYZ, FrequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, 
FrequencyBodyAccelometerMagnitude. (Note the 'Frequency' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
